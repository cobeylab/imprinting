Title: Calculate Birth Year-Specific Probabilities of Immune Imprinting to Influenza A
Version: 0.1.0

    c(person(given = "Katelyn",
             family = "Gostic",
             role = c("aut"),
             email = "kgostic@uchicago.edu"),

Description: Reconstruct birth-year specific probabilities of immune imprinting to influenza A, using the methods of Gostic et al. 2016 (DOI: 10.1126/science.aag1322). Plot, save, or export the calculated probabilities for use in your own research. By default, the package calculates subtype-specific imprinting probabilities, but with user-provided frequency data, it is possible to calculate probabilities for arbitrary kinds of primary exposure to influenza A, including primary vaccination and exposure to specific clades, strains, etc.
